### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a South African (Johannesburg) ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ born Software developer with 8 years of experience. Moved to Berlin ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª about a 3 years ago to explore the Berlin Tech space and learn as much as possible!

I am a hard-working individual with a passion for Technology. My friends would describe me as dedicated, efficient, reliable and overall a prolific developer. Nothing makes me happier than using my abilities and skills to improve the lives of others.

Attending developer meetups and conferences is something I do religiously. In my spare time, I enjoy playing a social game of football. Currently learning German and I aspire to become fluent in both speaking and writing. I'm also an avid gamer who, although sometimes I wish I could spend more time with my beloved Playstation.
