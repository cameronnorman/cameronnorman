### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a South African (Johannesburg) ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦ born Software developer with 5 years of experience. Moved to Berlin ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª about a year ago to explore the Berlin Tech space and learn as much as possible!

I am a hard-working individual with a passion for Technology. My friends would describe me as dedicated, efficient and reliable. Nothing makes me happier than using my abilities and skills to improve the lives of others.

Attending developer meetups and conferences is something I do religiously. In my spare time, I enjoy playing a social game of football. Currently learning German and I aspire to become fluent in both speaking and writing. I'm also an avid gamer although, sometimes I wish I could spend more time with my beloved Playstation.
